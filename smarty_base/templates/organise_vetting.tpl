<h2>Vetting events, why and how?</h2>
{literal}
<p>At ${ORGANISATION_NAME} we want to be as inclusive as possible in our LGBT Thames Valley events site, which means we want as many people as possible to be able to list their events for the widest possible community. In order to do this, we have provided a number of ways for organisers of events to list their events. Whether your event is a small one-off event, or if you have a large event that you run regularly, we want to provide you with the best possible way of listing your event with us, free of charge and in total confidence of your privacy.</p>
<p>In order to provide this facility in confidence, whilst also ensuring the integrity of our events listing, we provide two main options for listing: you can become a <a href="organise.php?display=register">registered organiser</a>, or you can <a href="organise.php?display=once">list events on an ad hoc basis</a>.</p>
<h2>Listing ad-hoc events</h2>
<p>If you have an LGBT event coming up that you would like listed here, why not consider listing your event without registering? You can do this wihtout having to signup with a user name and password, you will just need to provide us with the details of your event and a person who can be contacted about your event. Rest assured that the contact details you provide us with are kept in the strictest confidentiality, and will not be revealed without your permission. Whilst we prefer to display contact information for someone at any event, we are happy to show public contact details from your own private details if that suits your event.</p>
<h2>Registered organiser</h2>
<p>A disadvantage of listing ad-hoc events is that we can only list one event at a time, and we cannot - for various reasons - allow you to directly edit those events one they have been added. An alternative to to listing ad-hoc events is to become a registered organiser. The main difference between listing an event as a registered organiser, and listing an ad-hoc event, is that you can schedule events that occur regularly. So if, for example, you have an event that happens on the second Monday of every month, or the last Friday you just need to tell us, and it will show every month. You keep the same confidentiality assuarance.</p>
<h2>Vetting</h2>
<p>At ${ORGANISATION_NAME} we take your security very seriously, and we take the integrity of our events calendar very seriously. For this reason we need to vet all ad-hoc event listings, and - at least initially - all listings from registered organisers that have not yet been approved by ${ORGANISATION_NAME}. Whilst we would like to approve all listings automatically, the nature of the internet is such that we simply can't do this in all cases. In much the same way as we ask you to complete a CAPTCHA when registering as an organiser, or when listing a single event, a website simply doesn't know who an event listing is coming from, so it would be irresponsible of us not to vet event requests. Rest assured that we aim to vet events to our calendar as quickly as possible, but please be aware that both newly registered organisers and ad-hoc listings may take time to vet, so in those circumstances you are advised to place your listing - or register as an organiser - well in advance of your event. </p>
<p>If your event is approaching fast, and you want to be assured of a quick listing, please <a href="#">contact us</a> leaving a telephone number to call back on, and an administrator will endeavour to ensure you are listed as soon as possible. Please remember, however, that no matter how hard we try, the closer to your event you contact us, the harder it will be for us to approve the listing in time for your event.</p>

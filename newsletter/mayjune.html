<p><h2>Hello</h2></p>
<p>… and welcome to the first issue of Reading Pride’s newsletter for anyone interested in ‘helping out’ in the run-up to our 10th annual LGBTA Pride parade and festival.</p> 
<p>As Volunteer Coordinator on the Reading Pride Committee my role is to find and recruit volunteers to get involved in organising, promoting and supporting Reading Pride, either in the coming weeks, or on the day of the event. </p>
<p>I have volunteered for various charities over the years and many of my happiest memories, proudest achievements and closest friendships are a result of doing so.  I want to ensure that everyone volunteering for Reading Pride derives the same level of satisfaction and enjoyment from volunteering that I have (and still do), so finding you a role that you have the skills and time for, and that you enjoy, is paramount to me. </p>
<p>I do however appreciate that for some people, giving up even a couple of hours to volunteer might be impractical because of other commitments. Under those circumstances, you might think that you can’t help us in any way, but actually you can! In every newsletter I will be highlighting particular items and services that we need to source, and you just might know someone, or somewhere, that could provide what we need; all you need to commit is the time it takes to email me your suggestion!</p>  
<p>The purpose of this newsletter is therefore twofold – to let you know about some of the volunteering opportunities available and to highlight other, simple ways that you can support us as we gear up for the ‘big day’.</p>
<p>Thanks for supporting Reading Pride – please read on for ideas on how you can continue to do so, and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
<p>Fran</p>

<p><h2>Save the date!</h2></p>  
<p>This year’s special 10th anniversary Reading Pride is on Saturday 31st August. The parade will start at Reading Civic Centre at 11.30am. The festival site at King’s Meadow Park will open at 12 noon. </p>
<p>This year we will have a separate cabaret tent and a beauty bar offering fast-track beauty treatments alongside our established attractions such as the main stage, market stalls, fun fair and youth zone.</p>

					<div class="contentbox"><h2>Put up our ‘Save the Date’ publicity poster?</h2><p>We want to see gyms, colleges, community centres, supermarkets and LGBTA pubs and clubs throughout the Thames Valley displaying our publicity poster. The poster will shortly be available to download from our website and we’d be grateful if you could print out a few copies, take them around your local area and help us to spread the word. Please ask permission from the venue concerned beforehand, we don’t want you to get into any trouble on our behalf!</p></div>
					<div class="contentbox"><h2>Spot a good trading opportunity when they see it?</h2><p>If you’re out and about at other festivals or events this summer please keep a look out for vendors that you think would be a good fit for our Market Place trading area. It might be a commercial company selling anything from wigs to wedding cakes, or a charity sympathetic to LGBTA issues, but if you think they’d go down well, note down the stallholder’s details (or ask for their business card) and pass that information on to us so we can make ‘first contact’.</p></div>
					
				</div>
				<div class="rightcolumn">
					<div class="contentbox"><h2>Donate merchandise to go inside our festival goody bags?</h2><p>We’re open to creative suggestions from interested companies, but we’re currently thinking along the lines of pens, bottled water, notepads, key-rings and stress toys.</p></div>
					<div class="contentbox"><h2>Provide printing services to us free of charge or at greatly reduced rates?</h2><p>We are planning a big poster and leaflet campaign, and support from a local printing company would really help us out.</p></div>
